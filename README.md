## ?? Configuration and Options Pattern in .NET 9

This project demonstrates configuration management in .NET applications, from console apps to web APIs. It covers how to use the Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration library to manage application settings in a flexible and scalable way.

### ?? What is a Configuration Source and Provider?

A configuration source is where your configuration data comes from, such as JSON files, environment variables, command-line arguments, or user secrets. A configuration provider is a component that reads configuration data from a specific source and makes it available to your application.

### ?? Why Use Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration?

By leveraging Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration, you can easily combine multiple configuration sources, reload settings on the fly, and bind configuration data to strongly-typed objects using the options pattern. This approach helps you build maintainable and robust .NET applications with centralized configuration management.
